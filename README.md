# A Gentle Introduction to RAG Applications

Start by installing the required libraries:

```bash
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We'll be using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), so head over their site and install it. If you are running this in Linux, you can run the following commands to install Ollama and download Llama 3.1 8B.

```bash
$ curl curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh-fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
$ ollama run llama3.1
```
